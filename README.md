# Nim
This is a project part of the CS50AI course. I have only written the main functions: get_q_value, update_q_value, best_future_reward, choose_action. Honestly most of this project was written by the course,
In the gamne Nim, we begin with some number of piles, each with some number of objects. Players take turns: on a playerâ€™s turn, the player removes any non-negative number of objects from any one non-empty pile. Whoever removes the last object loses. 
The program is an AI that plays with it self and learns how to play the game using Reinforcement learning. Specifically, it uses the Q-learning model.
